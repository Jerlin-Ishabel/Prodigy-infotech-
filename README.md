# Prodigy-infotech-
Machine learning Internship 
It looks like you've completed a series of machine learning projects during your internship at Prodigy Infotech! Congratulations on successfully finishing these tasks. Here's a rewritten version of your text with some minor improvements for clarity and readability:

"I would like to express my gratitude to Prodigy Infotech for providing me with the opportunity to work on these exciting projects and for the invaluable support and guidance throughout my internship journey.

Here's an overview of my approach to the tasks:

*Task 1: House Price Prediction*
I built a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.

*Task 2: Customer Segmentation*
I used K-means clustering to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history, including frequency and total amount spent. This allows the store to tailor marketing strategies and product offerings to different customer groups.

*Task 3: Cat vs Dog Classification*
I implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to classify images of cats and dogs using the TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS) Cats vs Dogs dataset.

*Task 4: Hand Gesture Recognition*
I developed a hand gesture recognition model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately identify and classify various hand gestures from image or video data.

*Task 5: Food Recognition*
I aimed to develop a model that recognizes food items from images and estimates their calorie content using deep learning techniques such as CNNs.

I'm proud to have completed these projects and gained valuable experience in machine learning. Thank you again to Prodigy Infotech for the opportunity!"
